The test cases here are made using the Katalon recodrer (Google Chrome extension found here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/katalon-recorder-selenium/ljdobmomdgdljniojadhoplhkpialdid?hl=en-US)
Test cases as of right now are made in java though it we want to implement them to out java script they will need to be modified for java script.will be recorder as HTML files that are capable of being imported and run in the recorder.

To use recorder just open the extension on the site out with to use it on and hit record, the recorder will take all input and then hit stop to make test case.
If something takes longer to load then the test case tries to use an input the extension allows you to slow down the execuation of the commands to give pages time to load.

To Run an Upoaded test case just open the HTML file in the Katalon Reader extension.
