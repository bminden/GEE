        <p>This unit on thermal energy transfer begins with students testing whether a new plastic cup sold by a store
            keeps a drink colder for longer compared to the regular plastic cup that comes free with the drink. Students
            find that the drink in the regular cup warms up more than the drink in the special cup. This prompts
            students to identify features of the cups that are different, such as the lid, walls, and hole for the
            straw, that might explain why one drink warms up more than the other.</p>

            <p>Students investigate the different cup features they conjecture are important to explaining the phenomenon,
            starting with the lid. They model how matter can enter or exit the cup via evaporation However, they find
            that in a completely closed system, the liquid inside the cup still changes temperature. This motivates the
            need to trace the transfer of energy into the drink as it warms up. Through a series of lab investigations
            and simulations, students find that there are two ways to transfer energy into the drink: (1) the absorption
            of light and (2) thermal energy from the warmer air around the drink. They are then challenged to design
            their own drink container that can perform as well as the store-bought container, following a set of design
            criteria and constraints.</p>

            <p>This unit builds toward the following NGSS Performance Expectations (PEs) as described in the OpenSciEd
            Scope & Sequence: MS-PS1-4*, MS-PS3-3, MS-PS3-4, MS-PS3-5, MS-PS4-2*, MS-ETS1-4. The OpenSciEd units are
            designed for hands-on learning and therefore materials are necessary to teach the unit. These materials can
            be purchased as science kits or assembled using the kit material list.</p>
